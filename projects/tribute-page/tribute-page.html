          <h2>Early Years</h2>
          <p>Glint was born as Glaust, the scion of the Elder Dragon Kralkatorrik and worshipped him as one of his Branded Champions.</p>
          <p>The Forgotten purified the scion at the Altar of Glaust, granted her free will. Glaust became Glint, chose to side with the elder races.

          <h2>Guild Wars</h2>
          <p>Glint decided to free Tyria from the threat of Elder Dragons.</p>
          <p>While they slept, she collected Kralkatorrik's crystallized blood and laid eggs of her future scions.</p>

        <div id="tribute-info-block">
          <h2>Edge of Destiny</h2>
          <p>Destiny's Edge suggested that she should fight alongside them against Kralkatorrik.</p>
          <p>Surprised by their plan and believed they can win, Glint chose to fight alongside the guild.</p>
          <p>Sensing that they only had one chance of defeating her former master, Glint sacrificed herself during the battle.</p>

        <div id="tribute-info-block">
          <h2>Legacy</h2>
          <p>Glint died, but the last of Glint's Eggs, part of her legacy and the key to both saving Tyria and defeating the Elder Dragons had been in stasis...</p>
